#####Body#####

1. The Doctrine of the JEWS CONVERSION vindicated.

    _ CHAP. I. The Doctrine of the Jews Conversion no New or Singular Opinion. Who have opposed it. Mr. Baxter's great Worth acknowledged. Why to be answered. His Arguments against a National Conversion of the Jews summarily rehearsed.

    _ CHAP. II. There was not any National Conversion of the Jews in the Apostles Days; nor will there be until the Fulness of the Gentiles be come in. What is meant thereby. The Body of the Israelitish Nation, comprehending the Ten Tribes, not destroyed by the Romans. No extraordinary Conversion of the Jews in the Reign of Constantine. Of Jews converted in several Ages. Few Jews have ever embraced the Protestant, which is the only true Christian Religion.

    _ CHAP. III. The R••sons of Mr. Baxter's being so mistaken in his Exposition of Prophesies. Mr. Fox's Interpretation of the Forty Two Months. Mr. James Calvert considered. Grotius and Dr. Hammond not the best Interpreters. The Pope is [the] Antichrist.

    _ CHAP. IV. Dr. Lightfoot's Objections considered. The unparallell'd Wickedness of the Jews, and their long Continuance therein, not unpardonable. Antichristian Nations may be converted. Judaism not the same with Antichristianism. Rom. 11.26. vindicated. Authors that have written of the Jews Conversion. Dr. Lightfoot's Positions considered. Conjectures about the Time and Manner of the Jews being brought to own Christ. Rome to be first destroyed.

    _ CHAP. V. Concerning the First Resurrection. Such Things are affirmed in Scripture as do necessarily imply Two Resurrections. Many are already risen. Several Reasons mentioned inducing us to believe that the Resurrection of Saints and Sinners will not be Simultaneous. Confirmed by Scripture.

    _ CHAP. VI. That the Scripture speaks of the first Resurrection in express Terms. That famous Text, Revel. 20. considered and vindicated. That the Resurrection there spoken of is a Corporal Resurrection, proved by Six Arguments. That the Primitive Christians believed the Chiliad, and the First Resurrection, in the Literal Sense. Concerning the Sibyls. Testimonies out of them are of no Validity.

    _ CHAP. VII. Other Reasons proving a particular before the Universal Resurrection. The Day of Iudgment begins with the Millennial Kingdom. Daniel's Day of Iudgment and John's Thousand Years the same. The Thousand Years not past, but future. The Day of Iudgment will be here in less than a Thousand Years. The Lord Iesus Christ will appear in Person at the Final Destruction of Antichrist, when the Marriage of the Lamb shall be consummated, and New Jerusalem come down from Heaven. Which Things will be a Thousand Years before the ultimate Resurrection and Iudgment.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Objections answered. That the Iudgment described in Daniel and Matthew, alludes to the Synedrium. That Jews as well as Chistians have believed not only a Day of Iudgment, but that it should continue a Thousand Years. That there will be two Con•lagrations. The first beginning with the Thousand Years not Universal. Gog and Magog will arise out of some of the Nations that shall escape the Conflagration. Conjectures about the Americans. Dr. Twiss his Opinion of Mr. Mede. That notwithstanding the Glorious Presence of Christ in the New-Jerusalem, it is not impossible for Gog and Magog to make an Insurrection against the Camp of the Saints. The Conclusion.
